## handshake-domain-finder

available at [domainfindr/](http://domainfindr/).

this is just a proof of concept at present--the list of domains is frozen as of 9/25/2020.

### TODO:

- rewrite the UI in something like preact
- either implement lookups from a full node, or keep up with marketplace changes by periodically grabbing the latest domains sorted by descending date
